     * Creating a Lock object.

     * Two tryLock methods
     * <p>
     * 1. tryLock(): It will try to acquire the lock, if the lock is available, it will acquire it, otherwise it will
     * proceed with the rest of the code. It returns boolean. Suppose, tryLock() is part of if() statement -
     * if (lock.tryLock()) {
     *     // if lock is acquired.
     * } else {
     *     // if lock is not acquired.
     * }
     * In this case, tryLock() inside the if statement tries to acquire the lock, if it is successful to acquire the
     * lock, it will continue executing the if block. Otherwise, it will execute the else block. But it will not wait
     * to acquire the lock.
     * <p>
     * 2. tryLock(int, TimeUnit): It will try to acquire the lock, and if the lock is not available,
     * it will wait for the mentioned time and if it is successful to acquire the lock within the specified time, it
     * will continue to execute the if statement. But if it is not successful to acquire the lock (the lock is not
     * released or still busy), then it will execute the rest of the code. It also returns boolean. Suppose, it is part
     * of an if block -
     * if (lock.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
     *     // if lock is acquired.
     * } else {
     *     // if lock is not acquired.
     * }
     * In this case, it will try to acquire the lock, and if the lock is not available at that point of time, it will
     * wait for 1000 milliseconds, as specified. And then if it is successful to acquire the lock within that
     * specified time - 1000 milliseconds, it will execute the if block, otherwise, it will execute the else block.
