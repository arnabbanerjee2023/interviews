 * ReentrantLock - Means Re-entrant Lock, means re-entry within the lock is possible only if the same thread is trying

 * This lock keeps track of acquiring the lock. If a thread acquires the lock 2 times, then the thread should
 * release or unlock the lock 2 times too. Then only the lock will be released.
