          The below code tells the thread scheduler that the main thread, from where the join() methods called,
          will wait till the threads, t1 and t2, finish their executions. Once the t1 and t2 threads are finished,
          then only the main thread will resume.

          So, while having both the join() methods - t1.join() and t2.join(), we expect the counter value should be
          2000, as both the threads looped 1000 times and the counter gets increased 1000 times by each thread. So,
          the counter should have the value of 2000.
