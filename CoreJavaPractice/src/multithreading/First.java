/**
 * Thread lifecycle -
 * 1. New: A thread is created but not started yet.
 * 2. Runnable: After calling the start() method, the thread becomes runnable. The thread is ready to run.
 * It is currently waiting for CPU time.
 * 3. Running: The thread is running inside the CPU or executing and performing the assigned task.
 * 4. Blocked/Waiting: The thread is waiting or blocked for a resource or for another thread to perform an action.
 * 5. Terminated: This thread has completed its execution and finished.
 * <p>
 * Thread methods -
 * 1. Start(): Starts the thread or the execution of the thread. Makes the state of the thread Runnable. So that it can
 * be picked up by the thread scheduler to be executed inside the CPU Core.
 * 2. Join(): The calling thread waits till the called thread finished its execution, and calling thread joins the
 * called thread at the end of the execution of the called thread. So then the state of the called state becomes
 * Terminated, and the state of the calling thread becomes Runnable.
 * 3. setName(): To set the thread's name.
 * 4. setPriority(): To set the thread's priority - MIN_PRIORITY (1), NORM_PRIORITY (5) (default), and
 * MAX_PRIORITY (10).
 * 5. Yield(): To inform the scheduler that the running thread can release the CPU and can let other threads continue.
