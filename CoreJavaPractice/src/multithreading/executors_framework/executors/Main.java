/**
 * Executors Framework
 * 1. Executor: A simple interface (Functional Interface in reality) that has a single method - execute(Runnable),
 * which executes a given Runnable task.
 * 2. Executors: A utility class that provides factory methods for creating different executors, such as below.
 *      Different Executor instances (ExecutorService) -
 *      a) newFixedThreadPool(int).
 *      b) newSingleThreadExecutor().
 *      C) newCachedThreadPool().
 * 2. ExecutorService: An extension of the Executor interface that provides methods for managing the lifecycle of
 * tasks, such as shutting down the executor and awaiting termination.
 * 3. ScheduledExecutorService: An extension of the ExecutorService interface that provides methods for scheduling
 * tasks to run at a fixed rate or with a fixed delay.
